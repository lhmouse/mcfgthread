[This section is informative.

Initially, MCF Gthread was licensed under the GNU General Public License
(LGPL). There was a technical limitation that prevented MCF Gthread from
being linked as a static library, so LGPL was considered 'sufficient for
good use'.

The limitation about static linking has gone since a while ago. Now the
restriction of LGPL is causing a negative impact. It is time to make a
reassessment on what license we should use.

We acknowledge that it may not be appropriate to enforce the exact same
understanding of freedom about software on GNU's aspect.

As a consequence, we bring the GCC Runtime Library Exception to grant
you the freedom to not be subject to LGPL under some circumstances. If
you have received a copy of MCF Gthread without this exception, you are
allowed to apply it yourself.

The overall effect is that, if you link your code against MCF Gthread,
either as a static library or a shared library which is produced by a
purely GPL-compatible compiler or a purely non-GPL-compatible compiler,
then you may convey the result under any terms at your disposal, without
effecting a GPL violation.

Verbatim copies of version 3 of the GNU General Public License and the
GNU Lesser General Public License, and version 3.1 of the GCC Runtime
Library Exception, can be obtained from the 'licenses' directory, or
